        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/3 c. granulated sugar, plus extra for rolling</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 c. + 2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350Â° F, and line a standard
                sized sheet pan with parchment paper. Gather ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, beat with an electric mixer the melted butter,
                cream cheese, granulated sugar and vanilla extract until homogenized
                and fluffy
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, sprinkle the flour, baking soda and sea sale on top. Beat 
                in just to combine; do not over mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the mixture into 6-7 dough balls, and roll into balls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll each ball in extra granulated sugar before placing evenly
                spaced on the baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 10-11 minutes. They will be puffy when you remove
                them from the oven and start to crack as they cool. Let cool on
                the baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool
                completely.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        Store any leftover cookies in an air-tight container at room 
        temperature for 2 days.
