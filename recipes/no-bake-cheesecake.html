    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The cheesecake is simple and creamy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 c. sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz cream cheese softened</li>
        <li>1 c. powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 c. heavy whipping cream cold</li>
        <li>1 tsp cornstrach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine melted butter, graham crumbs, and sugar with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides (about 1 ½ inches) of a 9-inch pie 
            plate or an 8-inch springform pan. Refrigerate while preparing the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat softened cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy. Add powdered
             sugar and vanilla extract and continue to beat until fully incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, beat cold heavy whipping cream on low for 1 minute. Add the 
            cornstarch, increase the mixer speed to high, and beat for an additional 3-4 
            minutes until stiff peaks form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the cheesecake filling evenly into the prepared crust and refrigerate 
            for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with your favorite toppings and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Whipping Cream: Heavy whipping cream is recommended for the best flavor, and the 
        cream should be very cold before whipping. If substituting whipped topping, 
        the cornstarch can be omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cream Cheese: Low-fat or reduced-fat cream cheese may not set up as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graham Crust: I purchase graham crumbs at the store. To make your own, 
        add 21 graham crackers to a food processor and pulse to form crumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
        To Serve: If the crust sticks to the pan, dip the bottom of the pan in hot 
        water for a few seconds. The hot water will melt the butter on the edges of 
        the crust, and it will release easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        Freezing: This cheesecake can be prepared ahead of time and frozen (it’s 
        just as good thawed as the day it is made!). Place the pan in the freezer 
        and once frozen, wrap tightly in plastic wrap to seal completely. Thaw in 
        the fridge overnight.
