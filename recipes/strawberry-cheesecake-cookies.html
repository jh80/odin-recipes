    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to convection 350Â° F</li>
        <li>
            Mix cream cheese with sugar and vanilla with stand or hand mixer whisk. 
            Once well combined, scoop cream cheese in 1 tbsp balls onto a parchment 
            paper lined tray/plate. Place This in the freexer for 30 minutes to an
            hour. (Should come out to about 12 cream cheese balls)
        </li>
        <li>
            Put freeze dried strawberries into a food processor to turn into a powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            To start cookie dough, beat room temperature butter in stand mixer/by 
            hand for 3-5 minutes (or until butter turns off-white). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in brown sugar and white sugar to your butter. Beat the sugar with 
            the butter until the mixture is fluffy (about 2 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add buttermilk and stir into mixture. Mix in vanilla extract, strawberry 
            powder (and red/pink food coloring if desired). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to form your dough. 
            If using a stand mixer, mix on low. If mixing by hand, use a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your cream cheese balls are frozen well, flatten 1/3 cup cookie 
            dough in your palm and place 1 cream cheese ball in the center. Fold the 
            cookie dough around until it is well secured in the center. Pour sugar 
            into a separate bowl and roll cookie dough in. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake cookies for 10-11 minutes (for 1/3 cup scoop). 
        </li>
        <li>
            For perfectly circular cookies, use a circular bowl/cup/cookie cutter 
            and swirl around your fresh cookie to make edges clean. Then let 
            cookies sit on tray for about 10 minutes before removing.
        </li>
